# Chronicler

A personal Telegram bot for the author of a history account on X. You send a topic. The bot
researches it (Wikipedia ru/en, Tavily web search), pulls out atomic facts with sources, and
writes a post or a thread in Russian using only those facts. The bot never publishes to X: you
read the draft, check the sources under it, and post it yourself.

The point of the design is that an LLM invents dates, numbers and quotes. So the bot does not go
"request -> post". It goes "research -> facts with sources -> post only from facts", and code
verifies the links in between.

## Pipeline

1. **Plan queries.** From the topic the model produces 3-5 search queries, in Russian and
   English.
2. **Research.** Sources return snippets for each query.
3. **Extract facts.** The model pulls atomic facts, each with a verbatim quote from a snippet.
   Code checks the quote really occurs in the snippet text; a fact that fails is dropped.
4. **Write.** The model writes the post strictly from the facts. Code checks that every number
   and date in the post appears among the facts.
5. **Filter style.** Deterministic style checks, then an LLM critic pass. On a violation the post
   is regenerated with a note on what to fix, up to 2 attempts.
6. **Deliver.** Telegram receives the post, the facts with their sources underneath, and the
   buttons "короче", "в тред", "другой заход", "ещё вариант".

At the moment the repository holds documentation and `.gitignore` only. The `app/` tree is the
target layout.

## Running

Appears in HIS-2. There is nothing to run yet.

## Before committing

The target gate, which arrives in HIS-2 (these commands do not exist yet):

```bash
make check    # ruff format check, ruff lint, mypy strict
make test     # pytest
```

Never commit to `main` directly, and never push without asking. Branches, commits and pull
requests, including the Jira `HIS-` key convention, are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Project context

Product overview, locked decisions and hard rules are in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md), which is also
the index the AI assistant reads. The detailed guides live in [`.claude/docs/`](.claude/docs):

- [pipeline.md](.claude/docs/pipeline.md): steps, data models, what code checks
- [style-rules.md](.claude/docs/style-rules.md): rules for the text of a post
- [architecture.md](.claude/docs/architecture.md): layers, import direction, interfaces
- [decisions.md](.claude/docs/decisions.md): decisions taken and open questions

Keep these in sync with the code.
